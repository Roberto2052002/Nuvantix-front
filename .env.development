# Backend endpoint to receive contact form submissions (production or direct backend URL)
# Example: http://localhost:3000/submit
VITE_CONTACT_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000/submit
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000
# If you prefer using Vite dev proxy, leave VITE_CONTACT_ENDPOINT unset and
# use the proxy configured in vite.config.ts which forwards /submit -> http://localhost:3000
